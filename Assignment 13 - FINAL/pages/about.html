            <p>
                We are called <b>Reversed Rescue</b>; A rescue facility not just focused on rescuing the Pitbull breeds but also about rehabilitating them to be ready to find a forever home. We take on Fight/Bait dogs and severe medical cases along with stray pick-ups all over LA. We are a full training sanctuary for animals and their owners as well, new or old. A facility focused on the animal and the human, hand in hand (Paw). We empower owners with knowledge and focused skill so they can not only have a great pet companion but be a positive voice for the Pitbull breeds under BSL (Breed Specific Legislation) that are flooding shelters and being killed daily. We strive to spread the positive voice for our Pits that have a negative outlook in the media and put a stop to Kill Shelters in LA. We canâ€™t do this alone, we need your help. It is up to us as humans to be great the animals that only want to love and serve us.
